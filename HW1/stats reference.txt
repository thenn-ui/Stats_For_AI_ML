Let G be a graph of n vertices. Let C be a maximal clique in the graph G of size k.



Let G be a graph with treewidth tw(G).
By definition, a tree decomposition of G is a tree T such that each node in T corresponds to a subset (bag) of vertices in G, satisfying the following conditions:
•	Every vertex in G is in at least one bag.
•	For every edge in G, there exists a bag containing both vertices of the edge.
Let C be a maximal clique in G, and let v_1, v_2, ..., v_k be the vertices in C, where k is the size of the clique. Here, C is a subgraph of G.
Since C is a clique, all pairs of vertices in C are connected by edges in G.
Consider the bags in the tree decomposition. For each vertex v_i in C, there exists at least one bag in the tree decomposition containing v_i. Let's denote these bags as B_1, B_2, ..., B_k.
Since each vertex v_i is in at least one bag, we have bags B_1, B_2, ..., B_k corresponding to the vertices in C.
The size of the largest bag in the tree decomposition is at least max(|B_1|, |B_2|, ..., |B_k|).
Without loss of generality, assume that |B_1| is the largest among |B_1|, |B_2|, ..., |B_k|.

Therefore, |B_1| ≥ k.

The treewidth (tw(G)) is defined as the size of the largest bag minus one, so tw(G) ≥ |B_1| - 1.

Combining the inequalities, we get tw(G) ≥ |B_1| - 1 ≥ k - 1.

Since k is the size of the maximal clique C, we have tw(G) ≥ k - 1.
